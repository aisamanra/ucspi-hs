synopsis:            Haskell helpers for UCSPI applications
description:         The @ucspi-hs@ package contains a few small helper functions for
                     writing clients and servers that are intended for use with the
                     <http://cr.yp.to/proto/ucspi.txt UCSPI interface>. This is a
                     Unix-oriented interface in which an external application manages
                     network connections and passes them off to another program which
                     is given the relevant sockets as typical Unix file descriptors.
                     This is a convenient way of building small servers without the
                     boilerplate of socket management, and allows a given application
                     to be trivially reused with different underlying network
                     interfaces.
